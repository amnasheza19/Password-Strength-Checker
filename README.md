# 🔐 Password Strength Checker (Python)

A cybersecurity-focused password strength checker that evaluates password security using entropy calculations.

## Features
- Entropy-based password strength analysis
- Detects weak password patterns
- Provides improvement suggestions
- CLI-based tool (beginner friendly)

## How It Works
The tool calculates password entropy using:
Entropy = Length × log2(character set size)

Then classifies:
- Weak
- Medium
- Strong

## Run the Project
python password_checker.py

## Why I Built This
This project demonstrates basic cybersecurity awareness and secure password practices using Python.
